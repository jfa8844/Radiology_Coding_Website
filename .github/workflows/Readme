Supabase Database Migrations CI/CD
This repository is configured with a GitHub Action (/.github/workflows/supabase-migrations.yml) to automatically deploy database migrations to our production Supabase project.

How It Works
Trigger: The workflow runs automatically whenever new commits are pushed to the main branch.

Supabase CLI: It uses the official Supabase CLI to connect to our project.

Deployment: It executes the supabase db push command, which applies any new migration files found in the supabase/migrations directory to the remote database.

Local Development Workflow
To create a new migration, follow these steps locally:

Ensure your local Supabase server is running:

supabase start

Create a new migration file: Give it a descriptive name.

supabase migration new your_migration_name

Edit the new SQL file: Open the newly created file in supabase/migrations/ and add your SQL statements (e.g., CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, etc.).

Apply the migration locally to test it:

supabase db reset

Commit and Push: Once you've verified your changes, commit the new migration file to Git and push it. When your pull request is merged into main, the GitHub Action will automatically deploy it.

Credentials
All necessary credentials (Access Token, Project ID, and DB Password) are stored securely as GitHub Actions Secrets and are not exposed in the workflow file.
